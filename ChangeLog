2011-07-05  Kyle Lanclos <grappy@lanclos.org>

	* Release 2.3.

	* Support the use of 'include:' entries in an SPF record
	  in the update-whitelist script.

	* Ignore unrecognized entries in a TXT record in the
	  update-whitelist script, rather than raise an exception.


2011-02-08  Kyle Lanclos <grappy@lanclos.org>

	* Release 2.2.

	* Accept addresses and CIDR subnet notation with an ipv4:
	  prefix in an SPF record in the update-whitelist script,
	  in addition to the syntactically-correct ip4: prefix.


2010-12-05  Kyle Lanclos <grappy@lanclos.org>

	* Release 2.1.

	* Accept addresses and CIDR subnet notation without an ip4:
	  prefix in an SPF record in the update-whitelist script.


2010-02-16  Kyle Lanclos <grappy@lanclos.org>

	* Release 2.0.

	* Optional auto-whitelisting of IP adddresses added.

	* Addition of GNU autoconf and Makefile to ease installation
	  and reduce sysadmin overhead of digging out hard-coded paths.

	* Added a config file, eliminating the need to modify the
	  daemon code to adjust (typical) behavior.

	* Example whitelist file provided, appropriate for ingestion
	  by the new update-whitelist script.

	* Optional X-Greylist: header that provides additional
	  information on why a message was passed by grappy.

	* Minor restructuring of database tables, in particular, the
	  whitelist table now operates solely by IP address. The new
	  structure eliminates length limits on fields, and is amenable
	  to multimaster replication schemes that require primary keys,
	  such as rubyrep.

	* Miscellaneous bug fixes and speed improvements in basic
	  grappy operations, in particular, database connections
	  are now re-used between threads, and a few race conditions
	  have been eliminated.

	* Lots of internal cosmetic changes.
